# minall

CLI tool and Python library to apply a suite of Minet's data-mining tools on a heterogenous set of URLs.

---

## Description

[`minet`](https://github.com/medialab/minet) is a Python library, maintained by the [mÃ©dialab at Sciences Po](https://github.com/medialab/), that provides a suite of Python classes and functions to scrape data from the web and make API calls to various platforms. Normally to use `minet`, you call one of its CLI commands on a specific data set, such as a set of YouTube video IDs or a set of URLs from Instagram. What `minall` does is take advantage of `minet`'s many platform-specific tools and applies them to a heterogenous set of URLs, without needing to manually specify which API should be called. `minall` parses the input URL, activates the appropriate `minet` tools, and returns a unified set of metadata common to all the input URLs, which allows for comparative analysis.

## Install CLI / library

1. Create and activate a virtual Python environment, >= 3.11
2. Install the tool with `pip`.
   ```shell
   pip install git+https://github.com/medialab/minall.git
   ```

## Use as a CLI tool

To enrich a set of URLs in CSV `input.csv` and to write the results in directory `output/` in your current working directory, run the following command:

```shell
minall --input-links input.csv --config-file config.json --output-dir ./output
```

The input CSV file needs to have the columns `link_id` and `url`. (Future development: allow user to specify column names)

| link_id  | url         |
| -------- | ----------- |
| ID/12345 | example.com |

With the option `--config-file`, you will need to provide a JSON-formatted configuration file, which contains the necessary API keys for the metadata collection.

`./config.json`

```json
{
  "buzzsumo": {
    "token": "MY_BZ_TOKEN"
  },
  "crowdtangle": {
    "token": "MY_CT_TOKEN",
    "rate_limit": 10
  },
  "youtube": {
    "key": "MY_YT_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

A special feature of `minall` is that it creates an in-memory SQL database during the enrichment process and updates any metadata provided at input without losing any data. For example, if you have already used `minall` on a set of URLs, you can update those metrics by inputting the previous run's out-files. This is useful because, if a URL has been deleted or an API no longer returns a response for it, `minall`'s result files will keep the old data, rather than overwriting it with null values.
