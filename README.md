## Description

[`minet`](https://github.com/medialab/minet) is a Python library, maintained by the [mÃ©dialab at Sciences Po](https://github.com/medialab/), that provides a suite of Python classes and functions to scrape data from the web and make API calls to various platforms. Normally to use `minet`, you call one of its CLI commands on a specific data set, such as a set of YouTube video IDs or a set of URLs from Instagram. What `minall` does is take advantage of `minet`'s many platform-specific tools and applies them to a heterogenous set of URLs, without needing to manually specify which API should be called. `minall` parses the input URL, activates the appropriate `minet` tools, and returns a unified set of metadata common to all the input URLs, which allows for comparative analysis.

## Install CLI / library

1. Create and activate a virtual Python environment, >= 3.11
2. Install the tool with `pip`.
   ```shell
   pip install git+https://github.com/medialab/minall.git
   ```

## Use as a CLI tool

Quick example command for a CSV dataset `input.csv` with URLs in the column `url` :

```shell
minall --config minetrc.yml --output-dir ./output --links input.csv --url-col url
```

With the option `--config`, you provide a [Minet configuration file](https://github.com/medialab/minet/blob/master/docs/cli.md#minetrc), which contains the necessary API keys for the metadata collection.

`./config.yml`

```yml
---
buzzsumo:
  token: "TOKEN" # Used as --token for `minet bz` commands
crowdtangle:
  token: "TOKEN" # Used as --token for `minet ct` commands
  rate_limit: 10 # Used as --rate-limit for `minet ct` commands
youtube:
  key: "KEY" # Used as --key for `minet yt` commands
```

```shell
usage: Minall [-h] [--database DATABASE] [--config CONFIG] --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR --links LINKS_FILE --url-col URL_COL [--shared-content SHARED_CONTENT_FILE] [--buzzsumo-only]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --database DATABASE   [Optional] Path to SQLite database. If not given, database written to memory.
  --config CONFIG       [Optional] Path to configuration file. If not given, environment variables are expected.
  --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        [Required] Path to directory in which a links and shared_content file will be written.
  --links LINKS_FILE    [Required] Path to links file.
  --url-col URL_COL     [Required] Name of URL column in links file.
  --shared-content SHARED_CONTENT_FILE
                        [Optional] Path to shared_content file.
  --buzzsumo-only       [Optional] Flag indicating only Buzzsumo API will be called on links file.
```

A special feature of `minall` is that it creates an SQL database during the enrichment process and updates metadata provided at input without losing any data. For example, if you have already used `minall` on a set of URLs, you can update those metrics by inputting the files that minall previously produced. This is useful because, if a URL has been deleted or if an API no longer returns a response for it, `minall`'s result files will keep the old data, rather than overwriting it with null values.
