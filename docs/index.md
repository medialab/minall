This site contains the project documentation for the `minall` data enrichment workflow. The project's aim is to collect and update metadata about target Web Content.

`minall` relies on the Python tool and library `minet`, which this project's name references.

## Table Of Contents

The documentation follows the best practice for
project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [Diátaxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials.md)
2. [How-To Guides](how-to-guides.md)
3. [Reference](reference/root.md)
4. [Explanation](explanation.md)

Quickly find what you're looking for depending on
your use case by looking at the different pages.
