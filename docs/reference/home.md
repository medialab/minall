# Code base

The structure of the documentation resembles the code's architecture. Each page, as shown in the navigation bar on the left, represents a module or a folder descending from the source code's directory, `minall/`. The descriptions and examples of individual classes and functions are generated automatically from dostrings written in the Python modules.

Click through the pages/modules and scroll down to different Python objects, as seen on the pages' right-hand navigation bar, to explore how the code works.
